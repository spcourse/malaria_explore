    "# An introduction to the `os` module\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science and machine learning, managing data files and directories is a fundamental skill. For example, looping through all the files in some data set is a very common operation, and the `os` module provides the basic tools to do this with.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common issue is that code must be useable on different operating systems, where the underlying file system might have a completely different structure. For example, on Windows a file path might look like `C:\\Users\\name\\Documents\\test.txt` , whereas or Mac or Linux, it will look something like `/home/name/Documents/test.txt` . Note the different overall structure and the different slashes used to separate folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're working on Windows, Mac, or Linux, `os` provides the same unified interface to the underlying file system. You can use `os` to perform tasks like navigating the file system, reading file properties, managing directories, etcetera. For now, the basic functions in the `os` module are:\n",
    "\n",
    "[`os.listdir(path)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir) - Returns a list containing the names of all the files and folders in the directory given by `path`. This is the Python equivalent of typing the command `ls` in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`os.path.isdir(path)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.isdir) - Returns `True` if the `path` is an existing directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`os.path.isfile(path)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.isfile) - Returns `True` if the `path` is an existing regular file.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`os.path.join(path, *paths)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join) - Joins one or more `path` components intelligently. You can give this function any number of `path` strings, and it will join them together to one complete new `path`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last function is extremely useful when nagivating through multiple folders, as it will also adapt its result based on the Operating System your machine is running (which is what OS stands for). For example: `os.path.join('plankton', 'amphipods')` will give you the string `'plankton/amphipods'` on a Mac, but `plankton\\amphipods` on a Windows machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use these functions to examine and check the structure of our dataset."

    "where the coordinate $(0, 0)$ is always the top left corner of the image, and $x_0 <= x_1$ and $y_0 <= y_1$. This means `(x0, y0)` should be the top left coordinate of the bounding box, and `(x1, y1)` should be the bottom right coordinate. Some of the most common `ImageDraw` functions that use bounding boxes (reffered to as `xy`) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`ImageDraw.rectangle(xy)`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageDraw.html#PIL.ImageDraw.ImageDraw.rectangle): Draw the rectangle defined by the bounding box `xy`.\n",
    "- [`ImageDraw.ellipse(xy)`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageDraw.html#PIL.ImageDraw.ImageDraw.ellipse): Draw the ellipse inside the bounding box `xy`. Note that if the bounding box is a square, the result will be a circle.\n",
    "- [`ImageDraw.line(xy)`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageDraw.html#PIL.ImageDraw.ImageDraw.line): Draw a line from the first coordinate to the second coordinate in the bounding box `xy`.\n",
    "- [`ImageDraw.arc(xy, start, end)`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageDraw.html#PIL.ImageDraw.ImageDraw.arc): Draw an arc by only drawing part of an ellipse, which is defined by the bounding box `xy`. Starting from the 3 o'clock position moving clockwise, only draw the ellipse from `start` angle (in degrees) until `end` angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "These shapes can be used to highlight important parts of an image, or we can even use `ImageDraw` to add some clarifying text in the image. For now, we'll just briefly experiment with the usage of some of these draw functions. \n",

    "**Draw a face on the plankton of your choice, using at least 3 different shapes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: These plankton images are grayscale, so you can only draw on them in black and white. If you wish to draw in color, you can replace the `rotated_image.copy()` with a call to [`Image.convert(mode)`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.convert) and convert the image to `'RGB'` first.*"
